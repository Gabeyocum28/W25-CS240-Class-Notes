# Fulcrum API Test Scripts

This directory previously contained multiple test scripts used to investigate and troubleshoot Fulcrum API access for inactive forms.

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

All test scripts have been **successfully removed** because:

1. ✅ **Problem Solved**: The Query API solution has been integrated into `fulcrum_processor.py`
2. ✅ **Full Access**: Both active (413) and inactive (4,578) forms are now accessible
3. ✅ **Clean Codebase**: No obsolete test files cluttering the project

## 📋 **What Was Tested & Solved**

The investigation tested:
- 🔍 **Standard API endpoints** - Only returned 413 active forms
- 🔍 **Alternative endpoints** - All returned 404 or same active forms
- 🔍 **Various parameters** - `disabled=true`, `archived=true`, etc. (all failed)
- 🔍 **Pagination approaches** - Confirmed no additional forms
- ✅ **Query API breakthrough** - Successfully accessed all 4,991 forms

## 🚀 **Current Solution**

The `fulcrum_processor.py` now includes:
- **Query API integration** for accessing inactive forms
- **Smart form filtering** (active, inactive, all)
- **Search functionality** by form name
- **Bulk selection** capabilities
- **Comprehensive form listing** with proper status detection

## 🧹 **Cleanup Complete**

All test files removed:
- ~~`debug_fulcrum_api.py`~~ (obsolete)
- ~~`test_fulcrum_endpoints.py`~~ (obsolete)
- ~~`quick_test_inactive.py`~~ (obsolete)
- ~~`test_alternative_endpoints.py`~~ (obsolete)
- ~~`test_fulcrum_query_api.py`~~ (integrated into main script)
- ~~`test_search_functionality.py`~~ (integrated into main script)

**Result**: Clean project structure with fully functional solution! 🎉
