## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Setup
```bash
python fulcrum_processor.py
# Choose option 1: Setup API credentials
```

### 3. Export Data
```bash
python fulcrum_processor.py  
# Choose option 3: Filter records by status and export to CSV
```

## Main Features

### CSV Export with Photo Downloads
- Export filtered data with proper column names
- Concurrent photo downloads (4-5x faster)
- Organized folder structure with timestamps
- Photo indexing and record mapping

### Output Structure
```
cached/
└── {PropertyName}_{Status}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}/
    ├── {PropertyName}_data.csv
    └── photos/
        ├── photo_index.csv
        └── {record_id}_{field_name}_{photo_id}.jpg
```

### Speed Improvements
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Up to 5 photos download simultaneously
- **Smart Progress**: Real-time progress with milestone updates  
- **Error Isolation**: Individual failures don't stop other downloads
- **API-Friendly**: Rate limiting to avoid overwhelming Fulcrum

## Usage

### Main Menu Options
1. Setup API credentials
2. List available forms  
3. **Filter records by status and export to CSV** ⭐
4. Download Data
5. Setup property mappings
6. Setup target form (for imports)
7. Process property data
8. Batch process multiple properties
9. Fully automated processing (download + import)
10. **Explore classification structure** 🔍

### Export Workflow
1. **Select Status Filter**: Choose which record statuses to export
2. **Generate CSV**: Clean data with proper column names
3. **Download Photos**: Optional concurrent photo downloads
4. **Organized Output**: Everything packaged in timestamped folders

### Enhanced Classification Search 🔍
The tool now provides **deep classification search** that goes beyond surface-level matches:

- **Depth Tracking**: Shows exactly how deep each match is found in the hierarchy
- **Full Path Display**: Reveals the complete classification path (e.g., `LMH → NAVY → Bayview Hills District`)
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed search process for understanding how matches are found
- **Structure Explorer**: Interactive tool to explore the full classification hierarchy
- **Multiple Child Keys**: Searches through various nested structures (`children`, `items`, `child_items`, `sub_items`)

**Example Output:**
```
📁 Searching classification set: SCHOOLS
   Items in set: 10
   🔍 DEBUG MODE: Showing detailed search for SCHOOLS
  [D0] ✅ Heber Elementary School District (score: 0.50)
  [D1] ✅ San Dieguito Union High School District (score: 0.50)
  [D2] ✅ Santee School District (score: 0.50)
        📍 Full path: SCHOOLS → NAVY → Santee School District
```

### Smart Field Mapping System 🧠
The tool now features an **intelligent field mapping system** that learns and remembers your preferences:

- **Memory System**: Remembers successful field mappings across sessions
- **Synonym Matching**: Uses comprehensive synonym dictionaries for better field recognition
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures each source field can only map to one target field
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides intelligent recommendations based on field similarity
- **Learning History**: Tracks mapping attempts to improve future suggestions

**Key Features:**
- **One-to-One Mapping**: `Number` can only map to `Number`, not also to `Unit Number`
- **Intelligent Recognition**: `Slice Length` automatically matches `slice_length`, `length`, etc.
- **Cross-Form Learning**: Mappings learned from one form help with similar forms
- **Memory Management**: View, export, and manage your field mapping memory

**Example Smart Mapping:**
```
✅ Survey Date ← survey_date (exact match)
✅ Address ← property_address (synonym match)
✅ Slice Length ← slice_length (exact match)
✅ Expansion Joint Length ← expansion_joint_length (exact match)
✅ High Point ← high_point (exact match)
✅ Low Point ← low_point (exact match)
✅ Technician Notes ← technician_notes (exact match)
✅ Before Photos ← before_pictures (synonym match)
✅ Date Completed ← completion_date (synonym match)
```
